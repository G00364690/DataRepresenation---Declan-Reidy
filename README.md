# DataRepresenation---Declan-Reidy

## Disclaimer

The project attempts to fulfill the brief by creating a RESTful API, with AJAX calls and a web Interface.

Many of the functions used are ultimately those from the lecture series, with some adaption.

Much of the web interface is repackaged work of my own from my body of work in HTML.

## Contents

This project demonstrates:
1. flask server
2. RESTful API
3. SQL tables 
4. CRUD functionality (through server.py)
5. AJAX calls (not working correctly)
